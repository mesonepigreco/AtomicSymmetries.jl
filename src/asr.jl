ASRconstraint!

Apply the ASR constraint to a rank-`rank` tensor of dimension `dimension`.
The application works as 

```julia
my_asr! = ASRconstraint!(dimension, 2)
my_tensor = rand(nat * dimension, nat * dimension)
my_asr!(my_tensor)
```

This will apply the ASR constraint to the tensor `my_tensor` in place.
"""
struct ASRVectorConstraint!
    dimension::Int
end
function (asr::ASRVectorConstraint!)(tensor::AbstractVector)
    # Get the dimension of the tensor
    dimension = asr.dimension

    # Get the number of atoms
    nat = length(tensor) รท dimension

    mytensor = reshape(tensor, dimension, nat)

    # Apply the ASR constraint
    for i in 1:nat
        @views mytensor[:, i] .-= sum(mytensor[:, i]) / dimension
    end
end
